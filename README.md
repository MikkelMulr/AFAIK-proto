AFAIK - Prototype

AFAIK - As Far As I Know

Concept: Discussion style website or blog-like that allows users to post about something that they believe to have an understanding, but wonder if they could be wrong.

The idea came about after talking with someone and noticing the phrase "as far as I know" come up a number of times and it stuck in my head, making me wonder if
people out there ever think about this kind of thing, they must, right?


Ultimately just an excuse to design some new layouts and play with some new ideas.
